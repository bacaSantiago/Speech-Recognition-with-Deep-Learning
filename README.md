---

## Overview

This project presents a comparative analysis of two distinct methods for speech recognition:

1. A **hybrid model** combining **deep neural networks (DNNs)** with **Bayesian networks** to enhance speech recognition accuracy using probabilistic inference.
2. A **standalone solution** based on the **SpeechRecognition library** in Python, designed for real-time speech processing using simpler deep learning methods.

The goal is to evaluate these models in terms of **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **robustness** across various noise levels. By comparing the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, this project aims to identify potential improvements for future speech recognition systems.

The project employs advanced mathematical and computational concepts such as **Bayesian networks**, **probabilistic reasoning**, **deep neural networks (DNN)**, and **sequence modeling (LSTM)**. Furthermore, it integrates libraries like **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, **pgmpy**, and **SpeechRecognition**, making this an ideal project for understanding the complexities of modern **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**.

## Introduction

Speech recognition systems have become increasingly sophisticated with the integration of **deep learning** models, allowing for the accurate interpretation of human speech. Despite these advancements, **noise environments** still pose significant challenges, reducing the accuracy of **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** systems. To address this, two approaches are explored:

1. A **deep learning model** based on **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks combined with **Bayesian networks**, which improves speech recognition performance by leveraging **probabilistic reasoning**.
2. A **simpler solution** using the **SpeechRecognition library** for Python, which provides a ready-to-use implementation for real-time speech recognition.

This study aims to evaluate the performance of these two methods, comparing their **effectiveness in noise environments** and understanding their potential advantages and limitations.

## Theoretical Framework

### 1. **Speech Recognition Fundamentals**

Speech recognition refers to the process of converting spoken language into text. The system typically consists of several components:

- **Acoustic Model**: Converts raw audio into phonetic or linguistic features.
- **Language Model**: Helps predict the probability of a sequence of words, improving accuracy in interpreting speech.

### 2. **Deep Learning in ASR**

Deep learning, particularly models like **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **LSTMs**, has revolutionized ASR systems by allowing models to learn complex patterns in speech. These models can handle the **sequential nature of audio data**, making them ideal for speech recognition tasks.

### 3. **Bayesian Networks**

**Bayesian networks** are probabilistic graphical models used to model the relationships between different variables. In the context of speech recognition, they are used to improve decision-making by incorporating uncertainty and dependencies between linguistic features.

### 4. **Hybrid Model: DNN + Bayesian Networks**

The hybrid approach integrates deep learning (LSTM) for feature extraction and Bayesian networks for probabilistic reasoning. The **LSTM** is responsible for learning temporal dependencies in the speech data, while the **Bayesian network** improves decision-making under uncertainty by considering contextual relationships between words and phonemes.

### 5. **SpeechRecognition Library**

The **SpeechRecognition** library offers an easy interface for speech recognition tasks. It supports engines like **Google Web Speech API** and **CMU Sphinx**, making it accessible for various applications. The library is particularly useful for simpler tasks where real-time, lightweight processing is prioritized.

## Methodology

### 1. **Dataset**

The **LibriSpeech ASR corpus** was used for training and evaluating the LSTM model. This dataset contains hours of English-language speech data and includes various noise levels for testing. The dataset was processed into **Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)**, a common feature used in speech recognition to represent the audio spectrum.

For the **SpeechRecognition model**, pre-recorded audio files were used to test performance in different noise environments (clean, moderate noise, high noise).

### 2. **LSTM Neural Network Architecture**

The **LSTM neural network** was constructed using **Keras**. The model architecture includes:

- **Input Layer**: Receives MFCC features.
- **LSTM Layer**: Captures sequential dependencies in the speech data.
- **Dense Layers**: Provide non-linear transformation to classify the speech inputs.
- **Softmax Output Layer**: Provides probabilities for each word class in the speech input.

The LSTM model was trained using the **Adam optimizer** and **categorical crossentropy** loss. The **Bayesian network** was integrated to refine predictions, adding a probabilistic layer to handle uncertainty.

### 3. **SpeechRecognition Model**

The **SpeechRecognition library** was tested using the **CMU Sphinx engine**. Three noise environments were created to evaluate the performance of the speech recognition system:

- **Clean Speech**
- **Moderate Noise**
- **High Noise**

The system processed the audio files and compared the recognized speech against the expected transcriptions to evaluate performance.

### 4. **Evaluation Metrics**

Both models were evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly transcribed words.
- **Precision**: The proportion of relevant words among the transcriptions.
- **Recall**: The proportion of relevant words correctly identified.

These metrics were calculated at the **word level** for both models.

## Results

### 1. **LSTM Neural Network Results**

- **Accuracy**: 87.33%
- **Precision**: 92.64%
- **Recall**: 79.77%

The **LSTM model** achieved high accuracy and precision in recognizing speech in clean environments, demonstrating its ability to model temporal dependencies effectively.

### 2. **SpeechRecognition Results**

| **Noise Level** | **Accuracy** | **Precision** | **Recall** |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| Clean Speech    | 46.15%       | 44.44%        | 46.00%     |
| Moderate Noise  | 26.92%       | 21.21%        | 27.00%     |
| High Noise      | 7.69%        | 6.06%         | 8.00%      |

The **SpeechRecognition model** showed a significant performance drop in noisy environments, with accuracy falling to 7.69% under high noise conditions.

## Conclusion

This study compared two speech recognition approaches: the **LSTM neural network** combined with **Bayesian networks**, and the **SpeechRecognition library**. The **LSTM model** demonstrated superior performance, especially in handling noisy environments, while the **SpeechRecognition** model proved to be useful in controlled settings with minimal noise.

Future improvements could focus on enhancing noise robustness in LSTM models and exploring hybrid models that combine deep learning and traditional speech recognition engines to reduce computational costs while maintaining high accuracy.
